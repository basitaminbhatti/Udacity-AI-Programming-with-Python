# PROGRAMMER: Abdul Basit
# DATE CREATED: 30-03-20
# REVISED DATE: 
# PURPOSE: Create a function print_results that prints the results statistics
#          from the results statistics dictionary (results_stats_dic). It 
#          should also allow the user to be able to print out cases of misclassified
#          dogs and cases of misclassified breeds of dog using the Results 
#          dictionary (results_dic).  
#         This function inputs:
#            -The results dictionary as results_dic within print_results 
#             function and results for the function call within main.
#            -The results statistics dictionary as results_stats_dic within 
#             print_results function and results_stats for the function call within main.
#            -The CNN model architecture as model wihtin print_results function
#             and in_arg.arch for the function call within main. 
#            -Prints Incorrectly Classified Dogs as print_incorrect_dogs within
#             print_results function and set as either boolean value True or 
#             False in the function call within main (defaults to False)
#            -Prints Incorrectly Classified Breeds as print_incorrect_breed within
#             print_results function and set as either boolean value True or 
#             False in the function call within main (defaults to False)
#         This function does not output anything other than printing a summary
#         of the final results.
##
# TODO 6: Define print_results function below, specifically replace the None
#       below by the function definition of the print_results function. 
#       Notice that this function doesn't to return anything because it  
#       prints a summary of the results using results_dic and results_stats_dic
#

    Prints summary results on the classification and then prints incorrectly 
    classified dogs and incorrectly classified dog breeds if user indicates

                            classifer labels and 0 = no match between labels
                    idx 3 = 1/0 (int)  where 1 = pet image 'is-a' dog and 
                            0 = pet Image 'is-NOT-a' dog. 
                    idx 4 = 1/0 (int)  where 1 = Classifier classifies image

                            'as-NOT-a' dog.
      results_stats - Dictionary that contains the results statistics (either a
                     percentage or a count) where the key is the statistic's 
                     name (starting with 'pct' for percentage or 'n' for count)
                     and the value is the statistic's value 
      model - pretrained CNN whose architecture is indicated by this parameter,
              values must be: resnet alexnet vgg (string)
      print_incorrect_dogs - True prints incorrectly classified dog images and 
                             False doesn't print anything(default) (bool)  
      print_incorrect_breed - True prints incorrectly classified dog breeds and 
                              False doesn't print anything(default) (bool) 
    Returns:
           None - simply printing results.
